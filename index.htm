		<h1>Daniel Puente's Secretariat Application</h1>
		<h1>I Personal Information</h1>
		<p>1. Phone: 210-849-5675 Email: Puente2016@gmail.com or Dpuente5258@stu.neisd.net</p>
		<p>2. I am currently not in any extracurricular activities.</p>
		<p>3. English, Calculus, Economics/Government, a student aid period, and another elective of my choice.</p>
		<p>4. There are none. I am willing to move anything in my schedule to make it work.</p>
		<p>5. I do have a drivers license and have my own vehicle with access to it at all times.</p>
		<p>6. If I do not make secretariat, I will still participate in MUNSA by applying to be a member of the Tech team.</p>
		<h1>II Student Profile</h1>
		<p>My level of commitment for MUNSA is incredibly high. My experience these past couple years have been amazing and really incredible. MUNSA is a core ideal of what ISA stands for. It challenges the participants to gather multiple international perspectives to create a great event for not only ISA students, but for all who come from around the country (and world). Its importance is something that is rather hard to put into words. Coordination is key to an event as large scale as MUNSA, and it is something I will undoubtedly strive to handle. MUNSA not only provides one of the most exceptional conferences in the nation, but it allows students to grow both through every role considered in the conference, but additionally through roles as great as those in Secretariat.</p>
		<p>My skills vary over a wide array of subjects. The main skills I have are on the electronic side of things. This goes from video editing, audio engineering, photoshop, experience on both Mac and Windows, small amount of knowledge on HTML (that is increasing at a quick rate), and lighting boards. Not only this, but I love helping with how things should look aesthetically. I practice all of these skills on my own time and at church.</p>
		<p>“Well MUNSA is a student led conference that stands for Model United Nations San Antonio. This conference takes 3 days out of the week, involves over 1,100, and takes place on the Trinity College Campus. Students from all around the world come to participate in this event that challenges them to excel and thrive in a competitive and fun environment.”</p>
		<p>I’ve attended MUNSA XVII and MUNSA XIX. I also participated in the MUNSA fundraisers at Beto’s and the Pancake Dinner.</p>
		<h1>III Interpersonal Attributes</h1>
		<p>The role I typically play in groups is the person making the product (or the workhorse as I like to call it). After communicating with my partners,  I try my best to make sure the product could be in the greatest condition possible and aim to show my group that I am a valuable member. I am more or a observational learner. This is why technology has become such a huge part of my life because I use it as a means to learn my most important skills.</p>
		<p>The first thing I would do is ask the person why they had those feelings. If the person had reasonable statement then I would of course talk to the member of the secretariat to make sure they don't offend anybody, but if it was somebody spreading rumours with no evidence of wrongdoing on the member of secretariats part, then I would talk through with them about how and why they feel that way in hopes of helping them feel better about the individual. I really do care about peoples feelings and love helping people in any way possible so i’m sure I would be able to take care of any problems that come up.</p>
		<p>I work with adults much of my time out of school. With my church, my peers are mainly adults that I regularly engage in conversation with. Due to several years of this, i’ve been able to tighten my skills and execute a good conversation with a adult. Not only this, but since I play lots of shows with older bands with older members, I am constantly put in a position to interact with adults, so I would say 5 on the scale.</p>
		<h1>Supplemental and Position-Specific Questions</h1>
		<p>A good example of me operating successfully in a group setting takes place earlier this year when the juniors were assigned the social injustice project. The first thing we did was get everyone's input about the topic and assigned tasks to everybody. I made sure the work load was bearable for each member and that everyone stayed on track. This lead to a great product being made and really reminded me how important it is to have teamwork and communication within any group.</p>
		<p>Regarding the website, I will aim to maintain the high level of professionalism the site already has and to advertise the social media side of things to keep students engaged not only during the conference, but before and after. I will maintain the current parley page but add small aesthetic touches to make it look more pleasing.</p>
		<p>I would say I have a high level of proficiency when working with technology. I’m always experiencing something new and incredible when I'm online and soak up all the things I observe. I try my hardest to push myself to learn new things, and strive to keep my mind knowledgeable of the new, upcoming technologies.</p>
		<p>The first thing I would do is ask what happened before hand and if there was any physical damage or settings changed. Then I would force shutdown/reboot the technology at hand and get a fresh start. If I am able to check device manager I would do that next. If there is no apparent solution I will call the manufacture of the computer and the support line for the operating system. Hopefully from there I would be able to take care of the problem.</p>
		<p>I would love to do an internship related to learning computer skills. I had an internship at geekdom the summer before sophomore year and loved it! Even though the internship I was taking focused around filmmaking, being around all the coders, and tech guru’s really fascinated me. If needed, I would open up my schedule to sit down and learn from Josh how to maintain the website and tip’s and how to make the best product possible.</p>
